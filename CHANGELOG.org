* Version 0.1.0 on 2022-04-28

Initial release of the package.  Please read the manual.

The core idea for this package was implemented in the =prot-fonts.el=
file that is part of [[https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles][my dotfiles]] (now deprecated).  I was using it at
least since November 2020, though the underlying code was probably
implemented at an earlier date.
